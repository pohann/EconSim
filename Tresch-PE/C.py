The goal of this module is to solve for a consumer's problem with production 
externality.
In this model, we have an agent who consumes what s/he could produce.
There is only one good and two factors:labor and capital.
This agent have an CES utility(Tresch, 2014) and Cobbâ€“Douglas technology.

Specifically, I use the Cobb-Douglas technology described in Turnovsky & 
Monteiro(2007).
This production function incorporates the production externality of capital, 
which could be positive or negative. 
As more and more capital is accumulated,the agent would have more knowledge of 
how to fully utilize it. It would boost the productivity of captital.
On the other hand, the usage of capital could produce pollution that would 
exacerbate the productivity of capital as more and more capital is used(e.g. 
increasing water temperature for machines that need to be cooled down 
periodically)

    This class define the utility and technology.
    PE: the parameter for production technology.
    PE = 0(default): no externality from capital.
    PE > 0 : positive externality from capital.
    PE < 0 : negative externality from capital.
    Users could assign any value to the rest of the parameters. But for the 
    existence and uniqueness of solution, please carefully check for the 
    concavity of the objective function.
